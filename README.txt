Quadratic Equation in Standard Form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Quadratic Equations can be factored
Quadratic Formula: x =  −b ± √(b^2 − 4ac)2a
When the Discriminant (b^2−4ac) is:
positive, there are 2 real solutions
zero, there is one real solution
negative, there are no solutions in real numbers(complex solutions)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is the possibility for each user of subscribing to the base and login

Competitions of gradual difficulty
The user selects a counter-counting time to validate the diagnostics, 
and the results are set on the basis of each user

In the Algorithm section, 
the user is asked to enter the parameter values 
and then the result is displayed not only the result but all the steps to be taken to solve the equation. 

This interactive learning method solves all the equations of this category (infinite ) can also be used to verify any exercise.
